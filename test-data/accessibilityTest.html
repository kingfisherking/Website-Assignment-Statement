        </div>
        <div dir="ltr">
            Hello! My name is Akili Thompson Hall, He/Him pronouns; I respond to either
            Thompson or Akili, just let me know your preference! I am a highly motivated
            and adaptable professional with a background in customer service and a
            strong passion for technology. My journey into the world of software
            engineering is driven by a deep fascination with data analytics,
            cybersecurity, and software development. My experience in customer service
            has honed my communication and problem-solving skills, which I believe are
            invaluable assets for a software engineer.

            Right now I have 3 main goals that I’m always working towards

                    Education: I am constantly learning new things to prepare myself for
                    an entry level role within the realm of software engineering. I also
                    plan on continuing education at an accredited institution in pursuit
                    of a Bachelor’s

                    Experience: As I am self-taught in most areas, I would love to
                    understand more about the software industry so that I can quickly
                    achieve new heights once I have accepted a new role in the field. It
                    would also really help my confidence and potentially get rid of my
                    imposter syndrome.

                    Community: I’ve found that the most successful individuals are those
                    who have found a community of like-minded individuals who are in
                    pursuit of similar objectives and goals. I hope to make new friends

                    ask deep questions.

                    Dedication: I have been working towards moving into the field of

                    opportunities; and if one door closes, you better believe I’m going

                    Time management: This is one of the most important skills I’ve
                    curated. Whether it’s a solo project or a company wide initiative, I
                    am always working to keep myself on track.

                    Communication: As someone in the field of customer service,
                    communication has become a speciality of mine. I know how vital it
                    is to make sure everyone is on the same page.

                    Teachability: If you can’t tell by now, I am eager to learn and
                    always studying something. I have an innate ability to pick up on
                    things quickly and utilize the knowledge in a wide manner of ways. I
                    believe that there’s always a way to apply past lessons to new
                    challenges.

                <div dir="ltr">
                    Critical Thinking: Critical thinking is, well, critical. I subscribe
                    to the belief that mental flexibility and decision analysis are
                    necessary for all aspects of life. Thinking critically is the best
                    way to ensure success and I bring that belief everywhere I go..

        <div dir="ltr">
            While it’s nice to fit in, sometimes life requires you to think outside of
            the box. These are the qualities that make me stand out amongst the crowd.

                    Test driven: After my recent foray into software testing and crowd
                    testing, I’ve come to understand just how important it is to check
                    back in with yourself. After studying with the International
                    Software Testing Qualifications Board, I understand Agile
                    methodology and how to structure approaches around criteria and
                    requirements.

                    Creativity: My soul is that of an artist. While it can be
                    unconventional, I believe that innovation can often come from avant
                    garde places and through divergent thinking.

                    Empathy and Commitment to Accessibility: It’s not only important to
                    understand what others are going through, it’s imperative to grant
                    equity and accessibility whenever possible. As someone with a
                    disability, I am committed to making sure everyone can take part.

                    computing. As someone who seeks to fight the issues plaguing
                    humanity, I find that this mission aligns with personal goals to

                    Growth Mindset: Having a growth mindset is about believing that you
                    can develop yourself. A hunger for knowledge leads to embracing
                    challenges, persisting through setbacks, learning from criticism,
                    and consistent effort on the path to mastery.

            I love plants and I’m always trying to grow something I’ve never grown

            planting seeds!

            I’m addicted, I can’t go a day without the stuff. In all seriousness, I
            think about food constantly. I have very strong opinions about food, though
            I am captivated with exploring new flavors and experiences. If I’m not
            trying to come up with something new, I’m probably trying to perfect a
            recipe (or at least translating the instructions into something a single
            bachelor with a toaster oven could make).
