                    Hello! My name is Akili Thompson Hall, He/Him pronouns; I respond to either Thompson or Akili, just let me know your preference! I am a highly motivated and adaptable professional with a background in customer service and a strong passion for technology. My journey into the world of software engineering is driven by a deep fascination with data analytics, cybersecurity, and software development. My experience in customer service has honed my communication and problem-solving skills, which I believe are invaluable assets for a software engineer.

                    <span class="initial">While it&#39;s nice to fit in, sometimes life requires you to think outside of the box. These are the qualities that make me stand out amongst the crowd.</span>
                    <span class="opt1">After a recent foray into software testing and crowd testing, I&#39;ve come to understand just how important it is to check back in with yourself. After studying with the ISTQB, I understand more about things like Agile methodology or how to structure approaches around criteria and requirements.</span>
                    <span class="opt2">My soul is that of an artist. While it can be unconventional, I believe that innovation often comes from avant-garde places or through divergent thinking. </span>
                    <span class="opt3">It&#39;s not only important to understand what others are going through, it&#39;s imperative to grant equity and accessibility whenever possible. As someone with a disability, I am committed to making sure everyone can take part.</span>
                    <span class="opt4">Niantic sees a future where their technology and infrastructure paves the way for advanced robotics and adaptive computing. As someone who seeks to fight issues plaguing humanity, I find that this mission aligns with personal goals to disrupt rigid industries and revolutionize approaches to solving hunger, disease, and global conflict.</span>
                    <span class="opt5">Having a growth mindset is about believing that you can develop yourself. A hunger for knowledge leads to embracing challenges, persisting through setbacks, learning from criticism, and consistent effort on the path to mastery.</span>

                    <span class="opt1">Animation is my favorite medium of art. I&#39;m also fairly partial to comics. If you want to befriend me, you could simply talk about Bluey, Avatar: The Last Airbender, or Masaaki Yuasa. I hope that I can use this passion to assist Niantic in making world class digital experiences.</span>
                    <span class="opt2">I love plants and I&#39;m always trying to grow something I&#39;ve never grown before. Truthfully, I don&#39;t have a green thumb, but that won&#39;t stop me from planting seeds! I&#39;m deeply interested in hydroponics and aquaculture, I&#39;m hoping the inspiration Niantic brings to the adaptive computing space will help me further these interests!</span>
                    <span class="opt3">I&#39;m addicted, I can&#39;t go a day without the stuff. In all seriousness, I think about food constantly. I have very strong opinions about food, though I am captivated with exploring new flavors and experiences. If I&#39;m not trying to invent something new, I&#39;m probably trying to perfect a recipe (or at least making it easier to cook in a toaster oven). </span>
