# About Page for Website

## by Akili Thompson Hall

Hello, attached you should find the website "final.html" as well as all accompanying data

I wasn't sure what format/name you wanted me to give the actual website for review, so I'm hoping "final" is okay/straightforward.

I've also included all of the documents and files I used to create the website--mostly sandbox type files that I played around with. But to clarify, please only view the "final.html" as the assignment. I include the rest of the data to paint a larger picture about how I currently create things. A little chaotic, but hopefully you find the end result as impressive as I intended.

Works best in Firefox, Chrome, or Opera
Admittedly, I created this on a screen much larger than most and didn't test it until the last minute. 
I promise it looks really really good on a wide screen greater than 1500px
I really truly hope you read the about me because this is a beautiful website on my gigantic monitor I didn't account for when using pixel sizes. I'll send you a video if I make it to the next round, I am so proud of this but I am also just about out of time. 

The website converts to the accessibility mode when smaller than like ~800px
